# urWu8Snake
This repo contains a derivative of snake from the tiny e-book ["Easy 6502"](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/)  <em>by</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/skilldrick">Nick Morgan</a>, used and licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>. The game is presented in [here](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/#snake). I fully enjoyed and recommend working through it! This modified version was made for fun and to learn. In addition, it contains an accidental message: "You are what you ate".

## Viewing the original version
- Open the link above. 
- Scroll down to the emulator window containing the "snake6502" ascii art.
- Click assembe, then run.
- Use 'wasd' keys to drive the snake.

## Running the modified game
- Copy the contents of the [urWu8Snake.asm file](https://github.com/FrancoisVanEeden/urWu8Snake/blob/master/urWu8Snake.asm) into the emulator, assemble and run.
